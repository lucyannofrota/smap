<!-- The folder `src/classification_wrapper` contains the classification modules.

The `src/classification_wrapper.py` is a super class that wraps the classifier in a ROS2 Node.

The folder `src/classification_wrapper/classifiers` contains the classifiers.

`src/classification_node.py` is responsible to launch each classifier node. -->
